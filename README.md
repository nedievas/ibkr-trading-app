# IBKR Trading App

A C++20 desktop trading terminal for Interactive Brokers, built with Dear ImGui (Vulkan backend) and the official IBKR TWS API.

Designed as a high-performance alternative front-end for IB Gateway / TWS, focusing on execution speed, multi-window workflows, and real-time market visualization.

Distributed for research and personal trading use via IBKR accounts. No guarantees of correctness, uptime, or suitability for financial decision-making.

The “Interactive Brokers API Usage Notice” section must be reviewed prior to use. By using this software, users acknowledge and agree to its terms.

## Demonstrated Capabilities

- **Candlestick Charts** — Multi-timeframe OHLCV with SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, VWAP (with optional ±1σ / ±2σ volume-weighted bands), RSI, and volume. Optional **Volume Profile** overlay renders a horizontal volume-by-price histogram on the right edge of the chart, highlighting the Point of Control (the price where the most volume traded) and the ~70% Value Area — re-buckets to the visible Y-range as you pan/zoom
- **Trading Style Modes** — Four curated chart presets (Scalping = 1m / 2 D, Day Trading = 15m / 20 D, Swing = 1D / 1 Y, Investment = 1W / 5 Y). Each mode hard-binds its timeframe, history horizon, and the analysis params used by the auto S/R, breakout signal, setup overlay, and unguarded-stop suggestion — so the chart's recommendations stay coherent within a session instead of drifting as you pan or change windows. Per-chart, persisted to `~/.config/ibkr-trading-app/chart-modes.cfg` and restored automatically on reconnect
- **Auto Technical Analysis** — Toggleable, automatically detected support and resistance levels (clustered swing highs / lows, ranked by touch count), drawn as colour-coded dashed lines with touch-count labels; tunable swing window, touch threshold, and scan depth via the chart's Auto... settings popup. A **linear-regression trend line** (with optional ±2σ channel and L/4-bar forward projection) shows the prevailing direction colour-coded by slope. Optional **supply/demand zones** render as translucent rectangles whose thickness reflects the spread of constituent swings; an **imminent-breakout signal** ( ▲ LONG SETUP / ▼ SHORT SETUP ) appears when price sits inside a zone with Bollinger-Band compression and directional momentum. Five further toggleable overlays: **Donchian channels** (rolling N-bar high/low envelope), **Keltner channels** (EMA20 ± 2·ATR14), **auto-Fibonacci levels** anchored to the largest recent swing span, **classic daily pivot points** (P, R1-R3, S1-S3 from the prior trading day's OHLC; intraday only), and **breakout markers** (▲/▼ on bars that closed through detected S/R)
- **Setup Suggestions** — When the imminent-breakout signal fires, an optional structure-based **reference plan** overlays the chart with three dashed lines — entry (cyan), protective stop (red, padded past the longest-wick anchor with round-number avoidance), and target (green, anchored at the nearest opposing level) — plus an R:R tag and a suggested share count derived from the active account's NetLiquidation × configurable risk-per-trade. A `[Use suggestion]` button in the Trade panel stages a Limit entry into the existing confirmation modal — never auto-fires. R:R minimum, ATR padding, round-number pad, stop-limit offset, and risk-per-trade are all tunable; defaults reject any plan with R:R < 2.0
- **Unguarded-Position Guard** — A non-blocking yellow strip appears in both the Chart window and the Order Book window whenever a held position has no protective Stop / Stop-Limit / Trail / Trail-Limit on the same symbol. One-click `Place stop` builds a Stop-Limit on the opposite side of the position (full quantity, DAY/RTH-only) and routes through the existing confirmation modal — never bypasses confirmation. The suggested stop level is derived from the chart's auto-detected support/resistance; a `Dismiss` button hides the warning until the position quantity changes
- **Order Impact Preview** — Before submitting any order, both the Chart window's Trade panel and the Order Book's order entry form display a colour-coded badge previewing what the order will do to the current position — `OPEN LONG / SHORT`, `ADD TO`, `REDUCE`, `CLOSE`, or `FLIP` — together with the projected closing-leg P&L in dollars (and percent) at the prices currently entered, the post-fill new average cost (for opens / adds), and a two-leg breakdown for flips. Blue for open / add, green for reduce / close at profit, red for reduce / close at loss, orange for flip. When the Setup Suggestions overlay is active, a second line shows target / stop / R:R derived from the same fill-price math so risk and reward are visible side-by-side with the order ticket. Recomputes live as you type quantity or price
- **DOM / Level II** — Live order book ladder with click-to-trade
- **Order Management** — Place, track, and cancel Market, Limit, Stop, Stop-Limit, Trailing, MOC/LOC, MTL, MIT/LIT, Midprice, and Relative orders; full order status lifecycle including CANCELLING state
- **Market Scanner** — Scan for Top Gainers/Losers, Volume Leaders, 52W Highs/Lows, RSI extremes, and more
- **News Feed** — Real-time and historical news across Market, Portfolio, and per-Stock tabs with sentiment indicators
- **Portfolio Dashboard** — Real-time account-level P&L (daily, unrealized, realized), positions, equity curve, allocation donut, and performance metrics (Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Alpha, Beta, Win Rate)
- **Orders Blotter** — Live open orders and full execution history with commissions and realized P&L; order history restored automatically after reconnect
- **Symbol Autocomplete** — IB-validated symbol search with 300 ms debounce across all windows; invalid symbols automatically revert to the last confirmed ticker
- **WSH Corporate Event Markers** — Upcoming earnings, dividends, and splits shown as colour-coded vertical markers on the price chart (yellow = Earnings, cyan = Dividend, purple = Split) with hover tooltips; sourced live from Wall Street Horizon via the IB API
- **WSH Calendar** — Cross-symbol aggregate view of all upcoming corporate events for held positions and open chart symbols; filterable by symbol, date range, type, and importance; sortable table with colour-coded event types
- **Multi-Account Support** — On live sessions with multiple accounts, a selector modal appears at connect time; active account shown in the menu bar and stamped on every order
- **Paper & Live accounts** — Toggle between paper and live trading from the login screen
- **Watchlist** — Multi-tab symbol watchlist with 22 configurable columns (show/hide via Columns button); Mag 7 default preset; live bid/ask/last/size/52W/spread ticks; saved presets; layout and symbols persisted to `~/.config/ibkr-trading-app/watchlists.cfg` and restored automatically on reconnect
- **Replay Window** — Pre-market, intraday, and post-market playback of historical trading days fetched from IB. Play through a day bar-by-bar (1m to 1D timeframes) with progressive candle reveal, adjustable speed (0.25x to MAX), manual step forward/back, and scrubber. Two modes: **Analysis** (read-only review with real fill markers overlaid on the chart) and **Operate** — a full ChartWindow-style sandbox: BUY/SELL trade panel with all 13 order types (Limit/Stop/StopLimit/Trail/Trail Limit/MIT/LIT/etc.), chart-click order arming with dashed price-bubble overlay (single-click for Limit/Stop/MIT, two-click trigger+limit for StopLimit/LIT), Transmit-Instantly toggle + per-window confirmation popup (Ctrl+click always shows the popup), live position strip (qty/entry/last/unreal P&L from the simulated account), Order-Impact badge that classifies each staged order as OPEN/ADD/REDUCE/CLOSE/FLIP with projected P&L, and dashed working-order lines on the chart (separate STP/LMT legs for StopLimit and LIT). All paper orders go through the `ReplayEngine` — no live-market exposure. Group time-cursor sync keeps multiple replay windows in lockstep. State persisted to `~/.config/ibkr-trading-app/replay-windows.cfg`
- **Multi-Instance Windows** — Open up to 10 simultaneous Chart, Order Book, Scanner, News, and Watchlist windows to monitor multiple assets at once
- **Window Groups** — Link any windows into a color-coded group (G1–G4); changing the asset in one window instantly syncs all others in the same group
- **Layout Presets** — One-click workspace layouts: Trading Focus, Research, Full Desk
- **Responsive UI** — All toolbars and info bars wrap gracefully when windows are resized small; font size adjustable (Small / Medium / Large) via the Settings menu
- **Resizable Panels** — Drag the splitter bars inside the Order Book window to resize the DOM ladder, order entry form, and bottom tabs independently

## Requirements

### System

| Dependency | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| C++ Compiler | C++20 | GCC 11+, Clang 13+, MSVC 2022+ |
| CMake | 3.20+ | |
| Vulkan SDK | 1.3+ | Must include validation layers and ICD loaders |
| GLFW3 | 3.3+ | System-installed |
| Protobuf | 3.21.x | System-installed (`libprotobuf-dev`) |

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers \
                 libglfw3-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler \
                 cmake build-essential
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install vulkan-headers molten-vk glfw protobuf cmake
```

### Windows

Install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) and ensure CMake and a C++20 compiler (MSVC or MinGW) are on your PATH. GLFW and Protobuf can be installed via vcpkg.

---

## Install Interactive Brokers API

Download the official API:

https://interactivebrokers.github.io/

Extract it into the project root so that this directory exists:

```
twsapi_macunix.1037.02/IBJts/source/cppclient/client
```

IMPORTANT!!! Don't version this into the repository. Read License agreement.

> The Protobuf-generated files inside the API package were originally generated with Protobuf 3.12 and are incompatible with system Protobuf 3.21. The CMake build regenerates them automatically using `protoc` if the system version is detected.

---

## Build

```bash
# Configure (Release by default)
cmake -B build -S .

# Build (parallel)
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Run
./build/ibkr-trading-app

# --- Variants ---

# Debug build
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build

# Clean build
rm -rf build && cmake -B build -S . && cmake --build build
```

### Linux headless / virtual display

If running on a machine without a physical display (e.g., a server or WSL), set a virtual display before launching:

```bash
DISPLAY=:1 ./build/ibkr-trading-app
```

### Platform notes

- **Windows** — MSVC or MinGW; CMake handles Vulkan/ImGui linking automatically
- **Linux** — Ensure ICD loaders are configured (`/etc/vulkan/icd.d/`) and `DISPLAY` is set
- **macOS** — Requires Xcode command line tools; MoltenVK provides Vulkan over Metal

---

## Testing

The test suite uses [Catch2 v3](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and is fetched automatically by CMake. No extra install step needed.

### Run tests locally

```bash
# Configure with tests enabled
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DIBKR_BUILD_TESTS=ON

# Build
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

### Test targets

| Target | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `tests-core` | Pure logic: Timeframe helpers, DST/session classification, model struct defaults, enum string helpers, `ParseStatus`, `ParseIBTime` |
| `tests-ibkr` | IBKRClient message dispatch: inject `IBMessage` variants into the queue, assert callbacks fire correctly — no live IB connection required |

### Sanitizers (Linux)

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DIBKR_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DIBKR_SANITIZE=ON
cmake --build build --target tests-core -j$(nproc)
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1 \
  ./build/tests/tests-core
```

### CI

All three platform jobs (Linux, macOS, Windows) build and run the full test suite on every push and pull request. A dedicated `sanitize-linux` job runs `tests-core` under AddressSanitizer + UBSanitizer after the main Linux build passes.

> UI rendering (ImGui/Vulkan) and live IB Gateway connectivity are not covered by automated tests — these require a real display and a running IB session.

---

## IB Gateway / TWS Setup

The app connects to either **IB Gateway** or **Trader Workstation (TWS)**. You must enable API access before connecting.

### Enable API in TWS

1. Open TWS → **Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings**
2. Check **Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients**
3. Set **Socket port** (see table below)
4. Uncheck **Read-Only API** if you want to place orders
5. Add `127.0.0.1` to **Trusted IP Addresses** (or your machine's IP)

### Enable API in IB Gateway

1. Open IB Gateway → **Configure → Settings → API → Settings**
2. Same steps as TWS above

### Port Reference

| Account Type | Application | Port |
|---|---|---|
| Live | TWS | 7496 |
| Paper | TWS | 7497 |
| Live | IB Gateway | 4001 |
| Paper | IB Gateway | 4002 |

### Client ID

Each connection to IB requires a unique **Client ID** (integer). If you connect multiple programs simultaneously, use different Client IDs to avoid conflicts. The app defaults to `1`.

---

## Login Window

On launch, a login dialog appears before the trading UI loads.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Host** | Hostname or IP of TWS/Gateway (default: `127.0.0.1`) |
| **Port** | Auto-populated when you toggle Account Type and API Type |
| **Client ID** | Unique integer per connection (default: `1`) |
| **API Type** | Toggle between **TWS** and **IB Gateway** (updates default port) |
| **Account** | Toggle between **Live** and **Paper** (updates default port) |

Click **Connect**. The app waits for `nextValidId` from IB (which signals the connection is ready) before showing the trading UI. If connection fails, an error message is displayed with the IB error code.

On **live sessions with multiple accounts**, an account selector modal appears after the connection handshake completes. The selected account is displayed in the menu bar and stamped on every order placed during the session.

---

## Windows

The UI uses ImGui's docking system. All windows are dockable and can be rearranged freely.

### Multi-Instance Windows

Chart, Order Book, Scanner, and News windows support up to **10 simultaneous windows instances** each. Open additional instances from **Windows → IBKR → + New Chart / + New Order Book / + New Scanner / + New News**. Each instance has an independent symbol subscription and its own IB reqId range, so they never interfere with each other.

### Window Groups & Symbol Sync

Every window has a **group button** (`G1` / `G2` / `G3` / `G4` / `G-`) at the leftmost position of its toolbar.

- Click the button to assign the window to a group (or clear it with `G-`).
- When you change the asset in any grouped window — by typing a symbol in the chart search box, changing the symbol in the Order Book, or double-clicking a row in the Scanner — **all other windows in the same group immediately switch to that asset** and re-subscribe to live market data.
- Groups are color-coded: G1 = blue, G2 = green, G3 = orange, G4 = purple.
- By default, instance N starts in group N (e.g. Chart 1, Order Book 1, Scanner 1, News 1 all start in G1).

### Layout Presets

The **Presets** menu applies one-click workspace configurations:

| Preset | Windows shown |
|---|---|
| Trading Focus | Chart 1, Order Book 1, Orders |
| Research | Chart 1, Scanner 1, News |
| Full Desk | Chart 1, Order Book 1, News (G2), Scanner (G2), Portfolio, Orders |

### Chart Window

Real-time candlestick charting with technical analysis overlays.

**Timeframes:** 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1D, 1W, 1M

**Indicators (toggleable):**
- SMA 20, SMA 50 (periods configurable)
- EMA 20 (period configurable)
- Bollinger Bands (period and sigma configurable)
- VWAP (resets intraday)
- RSI (separate subplot, period configurable)
- Volume subplot with up/down coloring

**Drawing Tools:** Horizontal lines, trendlines, Fibonacci retracements, eraser

**Trading:**
- Place orders directly from the chart (MKT, LMT, STP, STP LMT, Bracket, TRAIL, TRAIL LIMIT, MOC, LOC, MTL, MIT, LIT, MIDPRICE, REL)
- **Bracket** — three-click chart placement: click 1 sets the **LMT entry**, click 2 the **STP stop-loss**, click 3 the **TP take-profit**. Entry is placed first so the STP/TP cursor bubbles can show the projected $ loss / gain, % move, and live R:R against the locked entry as the user positions each leg. Each click is side-validated (BUY: STP < entry < TP; SELL reversed) and out-of-side clicks are silently rejected so the user can reposition. The LMT entry is submitted on the third click; the STP and TP are submitted as an OCA pair (`ocaGroup="BRK_<entryId>", ocaType=1`) only when IB reports the LMT filled (via `onFillReceived`) — when one of the closing legs fills, IB auto-cancels the other. Cancelling the LMT before fill discards the pending STP+TP.
- Working orders displayed as horizontal lines on the price axis
- Current position shown with entry price, current price, and unrealized P&L strip
- **Current price line** — dashed horizontal line tracking the latest price, with a right-aligned price tag inside the chart
- RTH toggle to include or exclude pre/post-market bars

**Corporate event markers:** Upcoming earnings, dividends, and splits from Wall Street Horizon appear as vertical dashed lines on the price chart, colour-coded by type, with a hover tooltip showing date, type, description, and importance.

**Session bands:** Chart shades premarket, regular hours, after-hours, and overnight regions.

**Symbol history:** Last 10 symbols are remembered for quick switching.

---

### Trading Window (DOM)

Professional Depth of Market ladder for market microstructure analysis and fast order entry.

**Layout** — Three resizable panels separated by draggable splitter bars:
- **Left**: DOM ladder (drag the vertical splitter to resize)
- **Right**: Order entry form
- **Bottom**: Tabbed panel (drag the horizontal splitter to resize)

**Order Book:**
- Up to 50 bid/ask price levels (Level II) with per-exchange depth when available
- L2 "All" filter merges all exchange buckets into a single view, sorted correctly (bids high→low, asks low→high)
- Cumulative size from the best price, volume-at-price overlay from executed trades
- L1/L2 toggle with exchange filter dropdown

**Interactive order placement (via IBKR API):**
- Click any price level to pre-fill an order at that price
- Select order type: MKT, LMT, STP, STP LMT, TRAIL, TRAIL LIMIT, MOC, LOC, MTL, MIT, LIT, MIDPRICE, REL
- Select time-in-force: DAY, GTC, IOC, FOK, Overnight, OPG (on-open)
- BUY / SELL buttons confirm submission

**Tabs:**
- **Open Orders** — Working, partially-filled, and cancelling orders with cancel button; status badge covers the full lifecycle (PENDING → WORKING → PARTIAL → CANCELLING → FILLED/CANCELLED/REJECTED)
- **Execution Log** — Filled orders with commission and realized P&L
- **Time & Sales** — Live tape of last 2,000 tick-by-tick trades (IB `reqTickByTickData`); columns: Time, Price, Size, volume histogram bar, Exchange / Conditions; green/red/grey row tinting for uptick/downtick/neutral

---

### Settings

Open via **Settings** in the menu bar. A floating panel lets you change the font size:

| Option | Scale |
|---|---|
| Small | 0.85× |
| Medium | 1.0× (default) |
| Large | 1.5× |

All UI elements — text, widgets, padding, and spacing — scale uniformly. The setting takes effect immediately without restarting.

---

### News Window

Multi-source financial news with three tabs. Supports up to **10 simultaneous windows instances**, each independently grouped.

**Market Tab** — Real-time news ticks for major market symbols. Auto-updates as headlines arrive. Highlights breaking news.

**Portfolio Tab** — Historical news filtered to your current positions. Populated automatically when positions load after connection.

**Stock Tab** — Enter any symbol to search historical news archives. Click a headline to load the full article body on demand.

**Features:**
- Sentiment indicator per article (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
- Source attribution (Dow Jones, Briefing.com, etc.)
- Time-ago formatting ("5 min ago", "2 hrs ago")
- Filter by headline text

**Free news providers included:** `BRFUPDN`, `BRFG`, `DJ-N`, `DJNL`, `DJ-RTA`, `DJ-RTE`, `DJ-RTG`, `DJ-RTPRO`

> A market data subscription from IB may be required for some providers. Delayed/free tier still works for many sources.

---

### Scanner Window

Market scanning across stocks, indexes, ETFs, and futures.

**Preset scans:**

| Preset | Description |
|---|---|
| Top Gainers | Largest % gain today |
| Top Losers | Largest % loss today |
| Volume Leaders | Highest share volume |
| New 52W Highs | Stocks at 52-week high |
| New 52W Lows | Stocks at 52-week low |
| RSI Overbought | RSI >= 70 |
| RSI Oversold | RSI <= 30 |
| Near Earnings | Upcoming earnings reports |
| Most Active | Dollar volume leaders |
| Custom | User-defined scan code |

**Filters:** Price range, % change, volume, market cap, RSI range, sector, exchange

**Results table:** 25+ sortable columns including symbol, price, change, volume, PE, EPS, ATR, MACD, 52W distance. Gainers highlighted green, losers red. Portfolio holdings are marked. Mini sparkline chart per row.

Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds (configurable). Falls back to simulated data when IB is not connected (useful for UI testing).

---

### Portfolio Window

Full account and position dashboard.

**Real-time P&L header** — Account-level daily P&L, unrealized P&L, and realized P&L streamed live from IB and shown above the positions table.

**Summary cards (top row):**
- Net Liquidation Value
- Cash Balance
- Day P&L ($ and %)
- Total P&L (unrealized + realized)
- Buying Power

**Positions table:** Symbol, quantity, avg cost, current price, market value, cost basis, unrealized P&L ($ and %), realized P&L, day change, portfolio weight. All columns sortable and toggleable.

**Charts:**
- 90-day equity curve (line chart)
- Portfolio allocation donut (by market value, top holdings labeled)

**Bottom tabs:**

- **Trade History** — Closed trades with side, qty, price, commission, realized P&L, and timestamp. Searchable.
- **Performance** — Key metrics: Total Return, YTD, MTD, Day, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Avg Win/Loss, Profit Factor, Beta, Alpha, Volatility
- **Risk** — Advanced drawdown analysis and risk metrics

---

### Orders Window

Live order blotter with two tabs.

**Open Tab** — All submitted, working, partially-filled, and cancelling orders. Shows order type, quantity, limit/stop/aux prices, TIF, filled qty, avg fill price, commission, submission time, and a color-coded status badge. Cancel button per order.

**History Tab** — Filled and cancelled orders sorted by execution time (newest first). Order history is restored automatically after reconnect — orders placed in previous sessions during the same trading day are recovered via `reqAllOpenOrders` and `reqExecutions`. A filter toolbar (symbol, side, date-from, Load/Clear buttons) queries IB for historical fills beyond the current session; results appear with an amber tint to distinguish them from live-session captures.

---

## Connection Resilience

If IB Gateway or TWS closes unexpectedly while the app is running:

- The trading UI **stays open** with last-known chart data and positions still visible.
- An orange **DISCONNECTED** badge appears in the menu bar next to the account selector.
- The app **automatically retries** the connection every 5 seconds in the background.
- When Gateway comes back up, the app reconnects silently and re-subscribes all open chart and order book windows to live data — no need to restart or re-enter credentials.
- **Order history is recovered** — open orders from all client sessions and today's fill history are re-fetched automatically on reconnect.

---

```

**Threading model:**
- The IB EReader runs on its own thread and pushes typed messages (`std::variant`) into a lock-free queue.
- A dedicated send thread handles socket writes for order submission.
- The UI thread drains the queue during `ProcessMessages()` (called once per frame, 5ms budget) and invokes the corresponding `std::function` callbacks that update window state.
- This prevents any IB socket I/O from blocking the render loop.
